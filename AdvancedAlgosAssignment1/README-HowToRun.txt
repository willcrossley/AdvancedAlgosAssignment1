To get repo:
-pull from https://github.com/willcrossley/AdvancedAlgosAssignment1 (contains version history etc) DO THIS, ED FILE UPLOAD ISNT VERY GOOD
OR
-copy all files from ed wihtin the Assignemnt1 folder (preferabely not)

Requirements:
-.NET Framework 4.7.2 (later should work too), SHOULD be all thats needed.
-IDE or other runner, I suggest VS.

To run tests:
-In VS, build and run using the test explorer or right click on the test class name and run tests
