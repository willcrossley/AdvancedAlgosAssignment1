To get repo:
-copy all files from ed
OR
-pull from https://github.com/willcrossley/AdvancedAlgosAssignment1 (contains version history etc)

Requirements:
-.NET Framework 4.7.2 (later should work too), SHOULD be all thats needed.
-IDE or other runner, I suggest VS.

To run tests:
-In VS, build and run using the test explorer or right click on the test class name and run tests
